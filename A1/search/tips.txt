1. Play the sokoban game. Read sokoban.py and understand the structure of the code, and waterjug as well. look At the
   class slides and understand the algorithm pseudocodes.

2. Review the Pseudocode on the class slides and understand how the algorithms work. Before anything, start by
   implmenting fval because this is the easiest out of all the functions.

3. Start implementing the heuristics. For the alternate heuristic, thinking about all the edge cases, such as a box
   being deadlocked in the corners, in the edge, if there is a storage available etc...
