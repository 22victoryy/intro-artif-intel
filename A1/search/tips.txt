/** WRITE YOUR TIPS IN THIS FILE **/

1. Play the sokoban game. Read sokoban.py and understand the structure of the code, and waterjug as well. look At the
   class slides and understand the algorithm itself and pseudocode.

2. After implementing manhattan heuristic and fval, consider edge cases of Sokoban, such as deadlocked states,
   storage availability to improve your heuristics

3. After implementing alternate heuristic and making sure you pass at least a subset of the given tests, implement your
   weighted search functions and them. Repeat 2 and 3.
