/** WRITE YOUR TIPS IN THIS FILE **/

1. Before jumping straight into the code to attempt to formulate the problem, it is necessary playing the
   Sokoban game first so that you have a good understanding how the overall game works.

2. Review the Pseudocode on the class slides and understand how the algorithms work. Before anything, start by
   implmenting fval because this is the easiest out of all the functions.

4. Start implementing the heuristics. Start with manhattan distance, followed by the anytime astar and anytime gbfs as
   these functions are doable by understanding the logic and pseudocode, and with a bit of thinking. Move on to the
   alternate heuristic, thinking about all the edge cases, such as a box being deadlocked in the corners, in the edge,
   if there is a storage available etc.
