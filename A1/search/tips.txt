/** WRITE YOUR TIPS IN THIS FILE **/

1. Play the sokoban game. Read sokoban.py, search.py, waterjug.py to familiarise yourself, as well as looking over
   to the class slides for a better understanding of the algorithms.

2. After implementing manhattan heuristic and fval, consider edge cases of Sokoban, such as deadlocked states,
   storage availability to improve your heuristics.

3. After implementing alternate heuristic and making sure you pass at least a subset of the given tests, implement your
   weighted search functions and test them. Repeat 2 and 3.
