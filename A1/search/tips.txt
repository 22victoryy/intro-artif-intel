1. Before jumping straight into the code to attempt to formulate the problem, it is necessary playing
   Sokoban game first so that you have a good understanding how the overall game works.

2. Review the Pseudocode on the class slides and understand how the algorithms work

3. Before anything, start by implmenting fval because this is the easiest out of all the functions.

4. Start implementing the heuristics. Start with manhattan distance as this is so far the easiest, followed by the
   anytime astar and anytime gbfs as these functions are doable by understanding the logic and pseudocode,
   and with a bit of thinking.

5. Move onto the last portion, alternate heuristic. Think about all the edge cases, such as a box being deadlocked
   in the corners, in the edge, if there is a storage available etc. Write it down or draw it, whatever it helps you
   to formalise the cases

6. Implement the alternate heuristic, and continue testing to find edge cases

7. Submit it on MarkUs.
